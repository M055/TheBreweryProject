## Brief description
The project examines the craft beer industry in the US from a data science perspective. Data for the >7000 craft breweries around the US is compiled by scraping the web, data wrangling from government and private sources, and interacting with the Foursquare API. US breweries are found to be geographically clustered into just four clusters. A predictive model built to understand the properties that make a particular beer highly rated is examined, and a recommendation is made for where a brewery might find the greatest success, and what beer it should brew.
